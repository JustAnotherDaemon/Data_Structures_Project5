# Data Structures Project Example üè´

- This code is from one of my assignments in a data structures course from a few semesters ago.  

- To run this code, download the files and compile the "Project5.cpp" file with a C++ compiler. 

- Once this is finished, run the file as you would any other C++ file. (In a terminal window run "./Project5" in the directory where the compiled file is located. On Windows, run ".\Project5" in the file folder where the compiled program is located.) 

- The "Project5.txt" file has some sample text in it, however, you may choose to enter new text.  

- The only requirements of text entry are that you choose something over two characters and when running the program, you give it a number that is one above the number of characters in the "Project5.txt" file.
